# ResumeParser
The principle objective of Natural Language Processing (NLP)- based Resume Parser is 
to extract the necessary data about applicants without going through every single
resume physically, which eventually leads to a more time and energy-efficient process.
Resumes are normally presented in PDF or MS word format, And there is no specific format to
present/make a resume.
It is simple for us individuals to read and comprehend those unstructured or rather diversely
organized information on account of our experience and understanding, yet machines don't work that
way. Machines can not decipher it as effectively as we can.
The conversion of cv/resume into formatted text or structured information to make it easy for review,
analysis, and understanding is a fundamental prerequisite where we need to manage lots of
information. Fundamentally, taking an unstructured resume/cv as an input and providing structured
output information is resume parsing.
